# ztem_simpeg
ZTEM forward modeling and inversion in SimPEG as part of UBC course EOSC 556B using synthetic and real data. 

The forward and inversion steps are split over two notebooks. 

Notebook <xxx_demo.ipynb> is lighter and includes a decimated mesh, receivers and frequencies so it can run on a typical laptop. 

- <ztem_syn_fwd.ipynb> contains the forward model for a synthetic L-shaped model.
- <ztem_syn_inv.ipynb> contains the inversion for the synthetic L-shaped model.
- <ztem_real_fwd.ipynb> contains the forward model for a real Arizona copper model here: https://giftoolscookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/comprehensive_workflow/joint_mt_ztem/index.html
- <ztem_real_inv.ipynb> contains the inversion for a real Arizona copper model here: https://giftoolscookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/comprehensive_workflow/joint_mt_ztem/index.html
